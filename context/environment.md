# Environment — {{CLIENT_NAME}}

> Orgs, sandboxes, endpoints and **credential references**. Never credential values.

**Last reviewed:** 2026-10-05

## ⚠️ Never put secrets in this file

Record **where** a credential lives, never what it is:

- ✅ `Named Credential: Acme_ERP_Prod` · `LastPass: "Acme — ERP integration user"`
- ❌ a password, token, private key, session id, or connection string with credentials in it

## Salesforce orgs

| UAT | | Sandbox | | |
| Dev | | Sandbox | | refreshed: |

<!-- Sandbox refreshes change org IDs and user IDs. When one is refreshed, note the DATE here —
     it explains a whole class of "it worked last week" problems. -->
