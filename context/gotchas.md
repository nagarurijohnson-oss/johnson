## Platform

<!-- Salesforce / platform behaviour that is surprising, undocumented, or documented-but-wrong. -->

-

## This client's environment

<!-- Specific to this org: a validation rule that fires unexpectedly, a managed package that
     conflicts, an integration that rate-limits, a sandbox that behaves unlike production. -->

-

## Process

<!-- How work gets approved, deployed or reviewed here that is not obvious — an approval that takes
     three days, a deploy window, a person who must be in the room. -->
