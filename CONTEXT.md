# Context — {{CLIENT_NAME}} / {{PROJECT_NAME}}

> **This file is the index.** It is loaded into every Orchestrate session on this repo, so it stays

## The one-paragraph version

<!-- Replace this. Someone who has never seen this engagement should be able to read this paragraph
     and know what we are building, for whom, and why it matters. If you cannot write it in a
     paragraph, that is a finding — say so in context/goals.md. -->

## Where things are

| File | What lives there | Read it when |
|---|---|---|
| [`context/client.md`](context/client.md) | Who they are, org chart, decision makers | You need to know who to ask, or who signs off |
| [`context/environment.md`](context/environment.md) | Orgs, sandboxes, credential *references* | You are about to deploy or connect to something |
| [`context/goals.md`](context/goals.md) | What we are solving, success criteria, budget | You are scoping, estimating, or saying no to something |
| [`context/decisions/`](context/decisions/) | One dated ADR per architectural choice | You are about to relitigate a settled decision |
| [`context/history.md`](context/history.md) | Shipped / parked / abandoned, dated | You are wondering whether something already exists |
| [`context/handoff.md`](context/handoff.md) | Current state, in progress, next steps | **Start here** if you are picking this up cold |
| [`context/gotchas.md`](context/gotchas.md) | The things that will bite you | **Before** you assume something works the obvious way |

## Fast facts

<!-- The handful of things worth carrying inline, so a session that reads ONLY this file is not lost.
     Keep it to what changes rarely. Anything volatile belongs in handoff.md. -->

| Primary Salesforce org | {{SF_ORG_ALIAS}} |

## Current state

> **Start with [`context/handoff.md`](context/handoff.md).** It is rewritten at the end of every
> session; this index is not. If the two disagree, handoff.md is newer.

## Rules for this directory

1. **`CONTEXT.md` is required. Everything under `context/` is optional.**
   An empty `goals.md` is worse than no `goals.md` — it looks answered when it is not. Delete a file
   you have nothing to put in, or leave the `> **Not yet filled in.**` marker so it is visibly unfilled.
2. **Never put secrets in any of these files.** Reference the credential — the 1Password/LastPass entry,
   the Named Credential, the External Client App — never the value. A private repo is still a repo:
   it gets cloned, forked, backed up and shared.
3. **One ADR per decision, not one per meeting.** ADRs are for choices with tradeoffs someone might
   question later, not status updates. See [`context/decisions/README.md`](context/decisions/README.md).
4. **`handoff.md` gets rewritten at the end of every session.** If it is not, it rots within a week and
   the next person stops trusting it — which costs more than not having it.
5. **`gotchas.md` entries carry the incident.** "Cannot deploy Prompt Template content via Metadata API —
   silent no-op, must use Prompt Builder UI (hit 2026-09-10, cost 2 hrs)." The incident and the date are
   what stop the next person waving it away.
6. **Dated, not relative.** "Shipped 2026-04-12", never "shipped last spring". Someone will read this
   in 2027.

## How this connects to the wider picture

Patterns, standards and learnings that are **not specific to this client** do not belong here — they go
to Revecast's central ontology, where every future engagement can benefit from them. Client code and
client-identifying detail stay in this repo and never leave it.
